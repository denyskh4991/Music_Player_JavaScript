# Music Player Application
The Music Player Application is a sleek and user-friendly web tool designed to play and control audio files. It leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a seamless music listening experience with intuitive controls and a visually appealing interface.
<h2>Key Features</h2> 
<h3>- Audio Playback</h3> 
The primary function of the application is to play audio files. The app includes controls to play, pause, skip forward, and skip backward, giving users full control over their listening experience. A progress bar allows users to navigate through the track easily. 
<h3>- User Interface</h3> 
<h4>Song Information Display</h4> 
The song title and artist's name are displayed prominently, along with the album art in a circular, bordered frame. This design ensures that users have all relevant information at a glance. 
<h4>Control Buttons</h4> 
The app features three main control buttons: play/pause, skip forward, and skip backward. These buttons are large, easy to interact with, and visually distinct, with the play button standing out in black against the white background. 
<h3>- Visual Design</h3> 
The application boasts a clean and modern design, with a soft color scheme that contrasts a light background with black and white accents. The use of shadows and rounded elements gives the player a polished and stylish appearance. The circular buttons and album art contribute to a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing layout. 
<h3>- Responsive Design</h3> 
The player is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent and functional experience across various screen sizes. Whether on a desktop or a mobile device, the layout adjusts seamlessly to maintain usability and visual appeal. 
<h2>Technical Overview</h2> 
<h3>- HTML Structure</h3> 
The HTML structure of the application is centered around a `div` container that houses the music player interface, including the album art, song information, and control buttons. This organized structure makes it easy to extend or modify the app as needed. 
<h3>- CSS Styling</h3> 
<h4>Background and Layout</h4> 
The background of the app is a vibrant green, creating a lively and energetic atmosphere. The music player itself is centered on the page and surrounded by ample white space, which helps to focus the userâ€™s attention on the player controls and song information. 
<h4>Buttons and Icons</h4> 
The control buttons are styled with a combination of white backgrounds and black icons, using shadows to create a three-dimensional effect. The play button is particularly emphasized by its larger size and contrasting colors. 
<h3>- JavaScript Functionality</h3> 
<h4>- Play/Pause Control</h4> 
The `playPause()` function toggles between playing and pausing the audio track. It updates the play button icon dynamically to reflect the current state, switching between a play and pause symbol. 

      function playPause() {
          //Function implementaion
      }
      
<h4>- Progress Bar</h4> 
The app includes a progress bar that tracks the current playback position. Users can drag the slider to skip to different parts of the track. The bar updates in real-time as the song plays, providing visual feedback on the track's progress. 

    progress.onchange = function () {
        //Function implementaion
    }
